This study will compare the experimental combination treatment of romidepsin and oral azacytidine to single agent drugs already determined effective in patients with PTCL. For the purposes of this study, the single agent drugs already used to treat lymphoma are called investigator's choice (IC), meaning the investigator will choose which one of these drugs to administer. The IC drug options include romidepsin, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine given alone. Funding Source: FDA OOPD.",

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-STC) may have a curative role for these pts but its toxicity is high when myeloablative conditioning is used. Reduced intensity conditionings (RIC) can decrease transplant related toxicity and mortality. The investigators have recently proved feasibility and potential efficacy of a RIC regimen in relapsed PTCL patients.\n\nWe want to investigate whether it is possible to improve the outcome of alk negative PTCL pts, stage II-IV at diagnosis, by intensifying the therapeutic approach.\n\nThe intensification will be obtained by combining intensive chemotherapy, alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 humanised antibody) and auto- or allo-SCT in pts aged between 18 and 60 years (Clinical Study A) or adding alemtuzumab to standard chemotherapy (CHOP) in pts aged between 61 and 70 years(Clinical Study B).",

      "Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases caused by mature T cells, accounting for approximately 10% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). PTCLs have a worse prognosis than aggressive B-cell lymphomas; they are less responsive to standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens and responses are less durable. In an analysis of 341 patients with newly diagnosed PTCL who received anthracycline chemotherapy, 3-year PFS and OS rates were 32% and 52%, respectively, significantly inferior to matched patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).And patients who received consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) had no significant benefit. The prognosis of relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients is even worse. Among the 420 evaluable R/R PTCL patients in the COMPLETE registration study, the median OS of R/R patients were 29 months and 12 months respectively . There is still no effective second-line regimen that can improve patient survival, so treatment options urgently need to be optimized.We designed a randomized, prospective, multi-center phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy of chidamide combined with gemcitabine, vinorelbine and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome (Chi-GVM) in the treatment of patients with R/R PTCL. We expected to further improve ORR, PFS and OS.",

    "Brief Summary":
      "The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate of KW-0761 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. KW-0761 targets CCR4. CCR4 is the receptor for macrophage derived chemokines MDC/CCL22 and TARC/CCL17. Chemokines are considered to play a role both in the recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells for anti-tumor response and in the selective homing of neoplastic B and T cells.",
