The payment for lung cancer which occupies the largest part of National Health Insurance expense is over 15 billion in 2018. Because about 80% lung cancer patients are smokers in western countries the low-dose computed tomography screening focuses on the smoking population It is quite different in South-East Asia particularly in Taiwan that 53% of Taiwan lung cancer are never-smokers and the etiology and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. The preliminary results of prospective TALENT study indicated that family history plays a key role in tumorigenesis of Taiwan lung cancers but several important variables such as air pollution, biomarkers, radiomics analysis are not available limits the accuracy of lung cancer identification. Hence, it is critical to integrate most of factors involved in lung cancer formation into a multidimensional lung cancer prediction model which could benefit never-smoker lung cancers in Taiwan and East Asia even in the western countries. The investigators initiate a clinical study to validate the multidimensional lung cancer prediction model for never-smoking population by multicenter prospective study.",

      "Cancer is the leading cause of death in Western countries. In France cancer control plans (National screening programmes) and recommendations for the management of cancer patients (multidisciplinary team meetings), have been implemented. Evaluating the effectiveness of these policies aiming for improved prevention and management is essential. However to conduct such an evaluation, a baseline reference requiring ongoing, reliable and complete data collection is necessary and can be used for epidemiological research.\n\nThere is no cancer registry in the French Region Sud-Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. In view of this situation, the regional Health Agency appointed the public health department of the Nice Côte d'Azur University and the Centre for computerized pathology data collection (CRISAP-PACA) to develop a Cancer Observatory. Since 2005, the public health department collects data concerning invasive and in situ cancers from all the histopathology labs in the French Region Sud-Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, gathered in the CRISAP-PACA, and transmits incidence cancer rates to the regional Health Agency. In 2007, a quality control procedure, comparing a random sample of data collected by the Cancer Observatory with pathology lab reports, confirmed the validity of the collected data with fewer than 3% in disagreement with the report's conclusions. In 2008, the estimated completeness of cancer records collected from histopathology laboratories was higher than 90% for new cases of breast and colorectal cancer within the age range concerned by the screening programme. Since 2012, public and private hospitals treating cancer patients as well as the regional cancer network ONCOPACA, coordinating multiple team meetings, have been contacted to transmit to the public health department cases of cancer without histological diagnosis. In addition, patients with cancer have been geolocated to study the influence of environmental exposures on the occurrence of cancers (patients living near of waste incinerator, highways).",

      'Disability is part of being human. He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men.\n\nDisabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where "being a woman" and "being a disabled person" have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\n\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\n\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals\' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered "fragile", and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the "disabled-friendly accessible health care" practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\n\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women\'s cancers. Being diagnosed with cancer is undoubtedly devastating for anyone. For this reason, it becomes more important to raise awareness about the prevention, prevention, early diagnosis and development of a healthy lifestyle in women with physical disabilities, and to encourage health-seeking behaviors.',

VIA is a low cost, low resource cervical cancer screening method and especially useful for low middle income countries (LMICs) like India.\n\nWe propose to develop video-based tutorials, such that the ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs could be trained in performing and interpreting VIA with the use of this tutorial. The ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs have important roles in delivering health in rural/ semi urban areas and they will be trained using this tutorial.\n\nThe video-based tutorials will be made according to the 'Spoken Tutorials' methodology, developed at IIT Bombay. Video-based Tutorials has given skills based training to over 2 lakh students in the past four years on IT based topics. The tutorials are made available online free of cost. They are designed to be used without the need of an expert being physically present.",

      "Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the US, with over a million new cases diagnosed yearly. Young adults are increasingly at risk of melanoma. Contributing to the increasing skin cancer risk is the fact that US adolescents have the lowest skin protection rates of all age groups and also demonstrate increased exposure to natural and artificial UV radiation. Innovative interventions are needed to have an impact on skin cancer risk among young people. Unlike previous interventions, our skin cancer risk reduction intervention will be tailored (or personalized) to each individual participant and delivered via the Internet. The intervention will emphasize appearance concerns, which are known to be the primary motivation for UV exposure and lack of skin protection among young adults. This will be accomplished in part through the use of personalized facial images showing UV damage as well as computerized age progression demonstrations.\n\nPrimary Aim 1. To examine the efficacy of a tailored intervention delivered via the Internet designed to increase skin protection and decrease sun exposure behavior among young adults at moderate to high risk of developing skin cancer. Participants will be randomized to the tailored intervention, the Skin Cancer Foundation website, or an assessment only condition.\n\nAim 2. To evaluate whether sociodemographic variables (sex, race/ethnicity, skin type, family history of skin cancer), appearance consciousness, and past exposure and protective behaviors moderate intervention effects.\n\nAim 3. To evaluate whether Integrative Model constructs (UV-related knowledge, risk perception, beliefs, norms, self-efficacy, and intentions) mediate intervention effects.\n\nThe goals of future research would be to enhance the tailored intervention, for example, by adding additional contacts or Internet technologies or features, disseminate the intervention, assess the longevity of effects, and/or adapt the tailored intervention for use with other cancer risk behaviors or at risk groups.",

However, the overall survival (OS) of ES-SCLC patients was not significantly prolonged, with platinum combined with etoposide chemotherapy as the standard treatment. In recent years, the emergence of Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has made the treatment of ES-SCLC appear at the dawn. In Impower133 study, Atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly prolonged OS(median OS 12.3 months vs 10.3 months, HR=0.70, 95%CI 0.54-0.91, P = 0.007). Durvalumab combined with chemotherapy (CASPIAN study) is the first study in 20 years in which the total survival time of ES-SCLC treated by first-line therapy is 13 months, and there is no significant increase in adverse reactions compared with chemotherapy. Therefore, in 2019, NCCN also recommended Atezolizumab or Durvalumab+ EC regimens as a category 1 preferred option for first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.",

As in the United States as a whole, COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted ethnic and minority individuals within underserved communities; and in Rhode Island, African Americans, Hispanics and undocumented individuals living in communities such as Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, East Providence and North Providence have had the highest rate of COVID-19. These communities are also impacted by healthcare disparities to access and affordability of healthcare, and as such, may be among the least likely to resume cancer screening.\n\nThe Lifespan Cancer Institute will institute a project to address health disparities in cancer screening during the pandemic through the use of a targeted campaign involving social media. The goals will be to re-establish screening in the era of COVID-19 and ensure timeliness of care for those found to be at risk, or are positive for, cancer.",

      "Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. The association between inflammation and cancer is well established but the association between thyroiditis (inflammation of thyroid gland) especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and thyroid cancer remains controversial. Chronic inflammation leads to a repeated cycle of cellular damage and subsequent healing which contributes to inappropriate cell proliferation and subsequent neoplastic transformation. One of the most common forms of Thyroiditis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis which is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affects almost 5% of the population and is more common in women. For the first time, Dailey and Lindsay reported in 1955 an increased association between Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) and thyroid cancer. They reported 35 thyroid cancers in 278 patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, a prevalence of 17.7% which they considered higher than the general population . Since then, various studies have been done, some studies have reported an increased risk of malignancy in Hashimoto's thyroiditis; others have failed to find an association. Most of the studies that have been done to identify the association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer are retrospective. The purpose of this pilot case-control study is to identify the association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer, to determine if the presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis has any affect on the complication of thyroidectomy and prognostic factors of thyroid cancer.",

    "Brief Summary":
      "What's the purpose of this study? This 4-year study is designed: (1) to teach primary care physicians how to recognize low health literacy patients and effectively counsel them on cancer screening using risk communication and shared decision making and (2) to assess the impact of training on changes in physician communication behavior and changes in low health literacy patients' cancer screening behaviors. This study proposal is based on the hypothesis that physician training in cancer screening guidelines, health literacy, and communication skills will improve provider-patient interactions during encounters dealing with preventive health maintenance especially cancer screening.\n\nHow will the proposed study be implemented? Thirty-two physicians in the New Orleans metropolitan area will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups. The unit of randomization will be the health care organization or clinic. The intervention group will receive training in health literacy, cancer screening, risk communication and shared decision-making. The control group will not receive communication training until the end of the study. Physicians in both groups will undergo three clinic visits with standardized patients (actors trained to portray real patients; mystery shoppers) but they will not be aware that they are conducting visits with actors. The visits will occur at study enrollment and at 6 and 12 months. At the end of each clinic visit, the standardized patients will rate the physicians' communication skills. Each physician assigned to the intervention group will receive verbal feedback on communication skills from the standardized patients and complete a web-based tutorial. Physicians in the control group will not have access to the web-based tutorial until the end of the study.\n\nFor each physician, 10-15 patients with limited health literacy will be recruited to the study. Each patient will rate his/her perceived involvement with care and global satisfaction with care at study enrollment and annually for three years. Age and gender-appropriate referral rates for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening and patients' receipt of such screening will be assessed annually for three years. All study physicians, regardless of group assignment, will receive performance feedback (report cards) on their cancer screening rates among low health literacy patients in their clinic.",
